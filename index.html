                        After obtaining a bachelor's degree in the Japanese language, I began my career in software development as an IT Japanese Communicator. However, two years later, I discovered that I enjoyed the testing and quality assurance aspect of the job more than my role as an IT Japanese Communicator. I find it highly fulfilling to discover and report bugs, as well as the challenge of designing and executing tests that cover all necessary areas to ensure that a product functions as expected and meets the needs of its users. With an insatiable passion for bug hunting, a quick learning aptitude, strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, and effective communication skills, I aspire to become an expert in web application testing and mobile testing.
